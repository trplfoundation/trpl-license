Total Reciprocity Public License (TRPL)
Version 1.0, November 2025

Preamble
The intent of the Total Reciprocity Public License (TRPL) is to guarantee radical freedom and transparency in software architecture and functional generation, without infringing on the creative rights of the end-user regarding their personal content. While other licenses allow proprietary software to hide behind network APIs, microservices, or internal servers, this License ensures that any system deriving functional value from this software contributes back to the commons.

1. Definitions

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
* For software, this includes all code, scripts, interface definitions, and build instructions.
* For Machine Learning, this explicitly includes the model architecture, all training data sets (or detailed recipes to recreate them), and the final trained parameters (weights, biases, and hyperparameters).

"Standard Interface" refers to a standardized means of communication (such as HTTP, TCP/IP, or standard library calls), but specifically excludes the semantics of the data exchanged.

"Intimate Communication" refers to any interaction where data, control signals, or logic is exchanged between the Program and another work to achieve a unified functional goal. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Static or dynamic linking.
* Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
* RESTful, GraphQL, or other API interactions where the calling software depends on the specific logic or data structures of the Program.
* Shared memory or inter-process communication (IPC).

"Functional Output" refers to output generated by the Program that is intended to be executed, compiled, interpreted, or used as a structural component of a software system. This includes source code, object code, AI model weights, database schemas, and logic scripts.

"Content Output" refers to output generated by the Program that is intended for human consumption or data storage, and does not contain executable logic or functional structures derived from the Program. This includes audio files, video files, images, text documents, spreadsheets, and raw data sets.

"Deployment" means the use of the Program—internally or externally—for any purpose other than personal experimentation. This includes running the Program on a server, within a corporation, or providing it as a SaaS (Software as a Service).

2. Source Code Availability

You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program. However, if you Deploy the Program (internally or publicly), you must make the Corresponding Source Code available to:
1. All users interacting with the Program remotely.
2. All individuals within your organization who use the Program.
3. The general public, via a standard network repository.

3. The "Intimate Communication" Clause (API & Microservices)

If you create a system where proprietary software engages in Intimate Communication with the Program, that proprietary software becomes part of a "Combined Work."

Consequently, you must release the Source Code for the entire Combined Work under the terms of this License. Segregating the Program into a separate container, microservice, or server wrapper does not exempt you from this requirement if the services are functionally coupled.

4. Output Reciprocity and Exceptions

4.1 Functional Output
If the Program is used to generate Functional Output (e.g., a compiler generating binaries, a transpiler generating code, or an ML trainer generating Model Weights), that output is considered a derivative work of the Program.
* You must license such Functional Output under this License or a compatible Free Software license.
* You cannot claim exclusive proprietary rights over Functional Output generated by the Program.

4.2 Creative and Personal Content Exception
Content Output created using the Program is NOT subject to the terms of this License. The user retains full ownership and copyright of their Content Output.
* Exception Example: Music created by a synthesizer, text documents created by an editor, or spreadsheets created by a calculation engine are owned by the user.

Limitation: This exception does not apply if the Content Output embeds portions of the Program's Source Code (e.g., a runtime library or macro scripts) required for the content to function. In that case, the embedded code remains subject to this License.

5. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

If the Program is used to train, fine-tune, or execute an AI model:
1. Training: You must release the full Source Code of the model (including Weights and Training Data) if you Deploy the model. The resulting Weights are considered Functional Output.
2. Inference: You cannot keep the model proprietary if it relies on the Program for inference logic.
3. Generation: Raw media or text generated by the model is considered Content Output and belongs to the user, provided it does not contain Functional Output.

6. Installation Information

If you Deploy the Program on hardware (consumer electronics, IoT devices, or cloud infrastructure), you must provide "Installation Information." This includes all authorization keys, cryptographic signatures, or passwords required to install and execute modified versions of the Program on that specific hardware.

7. No Additional Restrictions

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose patent litigation clauses, non-compete clauses, or usage restrictions (e.g., "non-commercial use only"). This License is the complete agreement.

8. Termination

Any attempt to copy, modify, sub-license, or Deploy the Program or the Combined Work except as expressly provided under this License automatically terminates your rights under this License.
