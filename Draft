Total Reciprocity Public License (TRPL)
Version: Draft 1.1 (Work in Progress)
Preamble
The intent of the Total Reciprocity Public License (TRPL) is to maximize the freedom of software architecture. Unlike permissions-based licenses, this license conditions the use of the software on the reciprocity of freedom: if you derive functional value from this code, the systems facilitating that value must also be free. This License ensures that any system deriving functional value from this software contributes back to the commons.
1. Definitions
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
"Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
For software, this includes all code, scripts, interface definitions, and build instructions.
For Machine Learning, this explicitly includes the model architecture, all training data sets (or detailed recipes to recreate them), and the final trained parameters (weights, biases, and hyperparameters).
"Intimate Communication" refers to an interaction where the Program and another work are functionally dependent on each other to perform a primary purpose. This is defined strictly as:
Static or dynamic linking.
Shared memory or complex Inter-Process Communication (IPC) where data structures are shared.
API calls (REST, RPC, GraphQL) where the calling software exposes the Program's specific logic or data model directly to a user or another system.
"Functional Output" refers to output generated by the Program that is intended to be executed, compiled, interpreted, or used as a structural component of a software system. This includes source code, object code, AI model weights, database schemas, and logic scripts.
"Content Output" refers to output generated by the Program that is intended for human consumption or data storage, and does not contain executable logic or functional structures derived from the Program. This includes audio files, video files, images, text documents, spreadsheets, and raw data sets.
"Deployment" means the execution of the Program to provide a service, function, or output for the benefit of an organization, entity, or multiple users.
Personal Use Exception: Installation and execution of the Program on a personal device for the sole purpose of study, personal experimentation, or non-commercial content creation does not constitute Deployment.
2. Source Code Availability
You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program. However, if you Deploy the Program (internally or publicly), you must make the Corresponding Source Code available to:
All users interacting with the Program remotely.
All individuals within your organization who use the Program.
The general public, via a standard network repository.
3. The "Intimate Communication" Clause (API & Microservices)
If you create a system where proprietary software engages in Intimate Communication with the Program, that proprietary software becomes part of a "Combined Work."
Consequently, you must release the Source Code for the entire Combined Work under the terms of this License. Segregating the Program into a separate container, microservice, or server wrapper does not exempt you from this requirement if the services are functionally coupled.
Exception for Standard Tools and System Libraries:
The requirement to release Source Code for the Combined Work does not apply to "System Libraries" or "Standard Tools" (such as operating systems, compilers, interpreters, standard API clients like Postman or cURL, or web browsers) that are used merely to host, execute, or interact with the Program, provided those tools are not specific to the Program and are widely available to the public.
However, if a proprietary software component is created specifically to wrap, extend, or hide the functionality of the Program (e.g., a proprietary microservice wrapper), that component remains subject to the full terms of this License.
4. Output Reciprocity and Exceptions
4.1 Functional Output
If the Program is used to generate Functional Output (e.g., a compiler generating binaries, a transpiler generating code, or an ML trainer generating Model Weights), that output is considered a derivative work of the Program.
You must license such Functional Output under this License.
You cannot claim exclusive proprietary rights over Functional Output generated by the Program.
4.2 Creative and Personal Content Exception
Content Output created using the Program is NOT subject to the terms of this License. The user retains full ownership and copyright of their Content Output.
Exception Example: Music created by a synthesizer, text documents created by an editor, or spreadsheets created by a calculation engine are owned by the user.
Limitation: This exception does not apply if the Content Output embeds portions of the Program's Source Code (e.g., a runtime library or macro scripts) required for the content to function. In that case, the embedded code remains subject to this License.
5. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
If the Program is used to train, fine-tune, or execute an AI model:
Training: You must release the full Source Code of the model (including Weights and Training Data) if you Deploy the model. The resulting Weights are considered Functional Output.
Inference: You cannot keep the model proprietary if it relies on the Program for inference logic.
Generation: Raw media or text generated by the model is considered Content Output and belongs to the user, provided it does not contain Functional Output.
6. Installation Information
If you Deploy the Program on hardware (consumer electronics, IoT devices, or cloud infrastructure), you must provide "Installation Information." This includes all authorization keys, cryptographic signatures, or passwords required to install and execute modified versions of the Program on that specific hardware.
7. No Additional Restrictions
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose patent litigation clauses, non-compete clauses, or usage restrictions (e.g., "non-commercial use only"). This License is the complete agreement.
8. Termination
Any attempt to copy, modify, sub-license, or Deploy the Program or the Combined Work except as expressly provided under this License automatically terminates your rights under this License.
9. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

Summary of Changes in Draft 1.1:
Removed "Compatible License": In Clause 4.1, Functional Output must now be TRPL. No escape hatch to other licenses.

Postman/OS Exception: Added to Clause 3. You can use standard tools to talk to the software without open-sourcing the tool.

Strict "Intimate" Definition: Clause 1 no longer says "includes but not limited to." It lists 3 specific technical conditions.

Deployment Clarified: Personal study/experimentation is explicitly exempted.

Preamble Softened: Changed "guarantee radical freedom" to "maximize the freedom... conditions use on reciprocity."
